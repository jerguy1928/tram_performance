# tram_performance

This is a web application I made using the ArcGIS for Javascript API. This application shows the performance of the 
Yarra Trams tram network in Melbourne, Australia from 2016 - 2019.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use this app:
The map is color coded to show performance of each individual line in the tram network. Click on the filter in the 
top right corner to update the map and view performance data for the selected year. You can click on an individual tram
to get more detailed statistics about the performance of that line during the selected year.

Some jargon you might encounter in the app:

% Service delivered: Yarra trams uses a specific formula to calculate this figure, but it can roughly be interpreted as
the amount of scheduled tram services for a line that actually occured, accounting for issues like cancellations and shorts.
% Shorted: A shorted service a service that is cancelled midway because it is running too late. Yarra Trams may short a 
service so that a line's service can be readjusted to match the scheduled timetable as much as possible.
